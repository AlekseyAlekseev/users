# Startup API

Startup API is a drop-in user management tool for on-line projects and SaaS (Software As A Service) web sites.

It supports many registration and authentication methods, integrates with various useful services like newsletters and provides comprehensive administrative dashboard that helps make business decisions based on data collected from the users.

One of main goals for the project is to allow fast idea-to-product cycle so we all can concentrate on know-how and not the infrastructure.
